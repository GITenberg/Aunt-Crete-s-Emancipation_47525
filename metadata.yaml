description: Lucretia "Crete" Ward lives with her sister Carrie and niece Luella,
  both of whom are very selfish and treat her like a slave. Upon learning that Donald,
  the son of their now-deceased older sister, is coming to visit from out west, Carrie
  and Luella fear what others will think of them if they are seen with a "backwoods
  cousin" and leave for a resort. Donald is actually well-educated and rich, and pays
  for some pampering for Aunt Crete. When the two travel to the resort, it sets off
  a series of surprises.
